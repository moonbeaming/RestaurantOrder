# Restaurant Ordering App

## About Project

This is a web app I created that is based off [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/s6Qk0EjXqIcL7yQ6PbRaZu/Mobile-Restaurant-Menu?node-id=0%3A1) from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). and made using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Javascript ES6**(**anime.js** for v1.0). This app allows you to place orders for a restaurant. I mostly followed the give design but made some tweaks towards the end of development which I felt would improve user experience. You can access it [here](https://restaurant-order-roan.vercel.app/).

## Features

- View menu and cart, where cart disappears if everything in it is removed
- Add menu items to the cart and remove them
- Modal that requests for payment information
- Some transitions for menu items when page is loaded, and upon a modal's appearance

## Skills Used/Learned

Through this project, I made use of Javascript keywords and concepts like:
- data attributes
- .filter()
- .forEach()
- scrollIntoView()
- indexOf()
- splice()
- push()
- remove/add styles

From anime.js

- timeline
- translateX/translateY
